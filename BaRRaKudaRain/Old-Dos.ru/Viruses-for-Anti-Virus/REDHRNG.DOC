                REDHERRING virus - DIARRHEA variant included
                in CryPt newsletter, #1
                ********************************************

                The REDHERRING virus is the assembled version
                of the DIARRHEA variant included in the first
                CryPt newsletter.

                REDHERRING is a simple, encrypted appending
                .COM infector. However, it will destroy
                .EXE's in its search path by dropping a
                viral 'dummy' onto them. This viral dummy
                is not infectious. However, when the corrupted
                .EXE is called, the viral dummy will execute and
                display a message from the CRAZY EDDIE virus!

                If the .EXE is scanned it will test positive
                for either WHALE virus (VIREX), DIR (TBScan)
                or SPARSE (SCAN). Scan strings for these
                viruses are embedded in the dummy, causing
                the positive call.  F-PROT may or may not
                detect WHALE; it's heuristic scan will flag
                the file as dodgy.

                Have fun with REDHERRING.  Put it into a situation
                where someone has a viral scanner.  It will
                test their sophistication as they attempt to
                track down this confusing infection pattern.

                CONFUSION TO YOUR ENEMIES!
