Programmer:[8C[LiCl]
Language Used:[5CASM [TASM v1.0]

Notes:   This is the highly awaited Strain B ve[A
[47Crsion of The Mind Riot.  This
[9Cversion is 100% more dangerous than the fir[A
[52Cst version.  I used a INT
[9C13, AH 05 command instead of the normal INT[A
[52C 26.  This Virus goes off
[9Con May 16th, 1992 (a Saturday...when everyo[A
[52Cne is using their computer)
[9CIf it isn't 5/16/1992 then the virus will g[A
[52Co off within 33 mins. of
[9Crunning it.  This Virus prints a message to[A
[52C the screen each time that
[9Cit infects (or is used).  I added more encr[A
[52Cyption to this virus at the
[9Clast minute just for Otto Schtuck (YAM 92),[A
[52C and added the extra 33 min
[9Ctimer for Mr. Mike (YAM 92).  The extra tim[A
[52Cer should wipe out all XTs
[9Cthat don't have an internal clock, and will[A
[52C also wipe out some of the
[9Clamers that get this virus after the destru[A
[52Ccting date.
