## Contribute

The project authors welcome contributions, big or small. Members of the community frequently contribute bug fixes, enhancements, and documentation changes to improve the functionality and usability of the software.

All of the project source code is on Github. We recommend potential contributors familiarize themselves with [the project git repository](https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC) and Github in general.

If you want to contribute but do not have a specific topic in mind, review the [list of open bug reports and other issues that are in need of attention](https://github.com/NewEraCracker/LOIC/issues).

Changes may be submitted as [pull requests on github](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). After being submitted, project maintainers will review the requests, offer feedback, and merge the changes if they are acceptable.
